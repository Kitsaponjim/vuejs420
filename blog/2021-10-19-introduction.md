## Simple Navigation

Any good documentation has great navigation. This boilerplate has support for an organized sidebar fore cross-page navigation as well as an automatic generated table of contents for each page in your documentation.

## Search

The search component which is shipped with this boilerplate, automatically indexes all headlines in your markdown pages and provides instant client side search powered by [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/).

## Dark Mode

This seems to be a must have for any site in current year. Click the icon at the top right of the page and try it out for yourself!

## TailwindCSS

This starter uses [Windi](https://windicss.org) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for layout and styling. You can easily configure it by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file. [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) is included as well to keep the bundle size as low as possible and the website fast and snappy!

## Changing Colors

The most important colors are defined in the `windi.config.js` file, play with it and customize looks on your own.

## Greater SEO Support
This boilerplate is SEO friendly with Sitemap, RSS Feed and Google Analytics, which pre-built out of the box. 

## Make it your own

Of course this is just a starter to quickly get you going. After downloading and installing you can do whatever you want with this boilerplate. Check out the `src` folder and take a look at the components.

Geek blog uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Colors and spacing can easily configured. To change the accent color, you only need to touch a single line in the code.

Don't like how something was designed or implemented? Just change the code and **make it your way**.
