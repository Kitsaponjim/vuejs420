## How to Archive Post
To archive a post add `is_archived: true` to your markdown post. This will add div block
on top of the archived post with title and text. To change the default archive title and text add following
key to the .env file

```dotenv
ARCHIVE_TITLE='ARCHIVED POST'
ARCHIVE_TEXT='This Post is outdated.'
```
